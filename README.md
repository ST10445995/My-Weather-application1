The weather application is made purposeful for the users who may require the full details and preciseness of the weather to be known for their daily work and safety and stay informed about the weather reports.

 Critical points of a weather application: 
1.	Inform and Update Users : - Show up-to-the-minute weather conditions and forecasts. - Make them aware of the prevailing weather status regarding temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. 

2. Aids in Planning It allows humans to plan their day or week with the emphasis on exact events with the assistance of more accurate weather forecasts. - Help the user make informed decisions on what to wear, where to go, and what to do outdoors by providing the necessary information, including but not limited to weather conditions.

3. Impro - Alert of vital weather phenomena, including severe weather, storms, heavy rain, abundant snow, heatwaves, and other meteorological events that could pose exceptional circumstances. - Be enabled to prompt warn and provide safety advice, allowing users to take such steps as will be reasonable and necessary to avoid damage to themselves or their property. 

4. Let the users add and edit weather-based information in an application for locations. • Send hyper-localized and highly personalized alerts and notifications for any weather condition. 

5. Provide a user-friendly interface through which a person can easily access weather information. -Display data about the weather in understandable ways, such as good-looking charts, graphs, and maps.

1.	Current temperature, humidity, speed of the wind, and state of the weather it be rainy, sunny, or cloudy. 

2. Weather Fore - Weather forecasts can be availed for short-term (hourly) and long-term (daily, weekly. Display temperature readings at maximum and minimum, probability of precipitation, and weather conditions in force for each forecast period. 

3. Weather Alerts - Issue alerts and notifications for adverse weather conditions and warnings. - Advice on safety measures when in weather extremities.

 4. Weather Maps- they provide interactive maps with radar imagery overlay to display current and forecasted weather systems, storm tracks, and precipitation conditions. - Offer end users the possibility of following changing weather using visual inspection. 
 

End users will check weather conditions each morning to make a call on how to dress, and if it is necessary, take an umbrella or maybe even sunglasses.

 2. Event Planning - People planning outdoor activities or events can schedule dates on which the weather conditions will be favourable. 
3. Travel Planning - By finding their destination's weather forecast, travellers will be able to prepare and pack right to avoid travel interruptions emanating from the weather.

 4. Safety Ready Severe weather alerts can be sent to users to give them warnings and allow them to protect themselves and stay put, refraining from moving about while the storms rage outside. 

The purpose of a weather app is to deliver correct and timely information about the weather to the user so that he can take the right action and be safe. In addition to the current weather updates and forecasts, it also serves severe weather alerts, thus making it a one-stop application for everyday life, travel, planning events, and safety readiness. 
  

Use of GitHub and GitHub Actions for an Application

GitHub and GitHub Actions create a rich platform to handle, develop, and deploy applications quickly. Together, the functionalities of these tools establish a smooth process in the software development lifecycle for version control, collaborative coding, and continuous integration and deployment. Let's see how these tools can be effectively harnessed:

#### Using GitHub
This web facility uses Git version control, enabling developers to work on projects together, manage code, and streamline the development workflow. So, this is how GitHub can be utilized for application development:

-Repositories Store your application's source code in GitHub; a repository is the central hub for all project files and version history.
Branches - Make branches for new functionality, bug fixes, or experiments without disturbing the base code so that many developers can work in parallel.
-Commits Record changes through commit messages that describe what was changed and why. This gives a detailed history of how the project has evolved.


3. **Project Management
- **Projects**: You can organize issues and PRs in Kanban-style project boards for workflow management and progress tracking. 
- **Milestones**: Group issues and PRs into milestones to track progress towards specific goals or 
Creating a README file to provide an overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for your application.

GitHub Actions is an automation tool integrated with GitHub that allows developers to automate their workflows. Here's how you can use GitHub Actions with your application:

- Automated Test: Set workflows to run the test automation, which tests different settings and configurations when code is pushed or PR created. This is to ensure that new changes do not break the existing functionality.
- Build and Deployment: Automate building/delivery of applications to different environments—staging, production, among others—may involve deploying to cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud or container registries like Docker Hub.

3. Custom Work
Scheduled Tasks You can schedule workflows to execute at various times to initiate tasks associated with regular maintenance of systems, backups, or even updates.
Sensitive information like API keys and credentials should be kept securely in GitHub Secrets. These later on could be utilized in workflows, remaining utterly invisible from the codebase.

Developers make feature branches from the main branch for coding changes. - They make changes with descriptive commit messages and push them to GitHub.

They submit a pull request to the main branch for a merge.


A GitHub Actions workflow is automatically triggered when a pull request is opened.

-It automatically launches tests alongside linters and security checks. - The team members review the pull request in case all checks pass. 
3. Continuous Development - When the pull request is approved and merged, another GitHub Actions workflow is triggered. - Builds the application and deploys it in a staging environment. - After successful deployment and testing of the application in the staging phase, it would be promoted into production. 
example, scheduled workflows run every night to carry out tasks like data backup, logs cleaning, or updating dependencies. The security workflows are scanned to scan any vulnerability in the code and its dependencies, ensuring the application remains protected. 
This affords a great solution in the way developers will have reasonable version control and collaboration throughout the management of the development life of an application. GitHub provides some great features for version control, collaboration, and project management. GitHub Actions brings advanced automation to assist with continuous integration, deployment, and custom workflows. With these features, developers can be more productive in maintaining code quality and ensuring reliable delivery of software.
